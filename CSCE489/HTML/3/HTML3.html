			The difference between cell spacing and cell padding is important to the formatting of a table. Cell space is the space between two individual cells. Cell padding is the space between a cell wall and the content within it. 

			The first table below has no cell spacing or cell padding specified. 

		</p>
		<table border = "1">
  			<tr>
    			<th>Team</th>
   				<th>City</th>
   				<th>In Texas?</th>
  			</tr>
 			<tr>
   				<td>Spurs</td>
   				<td>San Antonio</td>
   				<td rowspan = "2">Yes</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
   				<td>Rockets</td>
   				<td>Houson</td>
  			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>

			The table below has cell spacing set to 10 and no cell padding showing an increased amount of space between individual cells

		</p>
		<table cellspacing = "10" border = "1">
  			<tr>
    			<th>Team</th>
   				<th>City</th>
   				<th>In Texas?</th>
  			</tr>
 			<tr>
   				<td>Spurs</td>
   				<td>San Antonio</td>
   				<td rowspan = "2">Yes</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
   				<td>Rockets</td>
   				<td>Houson</td>
  			</tr>
		</table>

			The table below has cell padding set to 10 and no cell spacing to show an increased amount of space between content within a cell and the cell wall
		</p>

		<table cellpadding = "10" border = "1">
  			<tr>
    			<th>Team</th>
   				<th>City</th>
   				<th>In Texas?</th>
  			</tr>
 			<tr>
   				<td>Spurs</td>
   				<td>San Antonio</td>
   				<td rowspan = "2">Yes</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
   				<td>Rockets</td>
   				<td>Houson</td>
  			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			The three tables below show the same difference between cell padding and cell spacing illustrated in the previous three tables except with 'colspan' utilized as opposed to 'rowspan' in the previous tables. There is no cell spacing or cell padding specified in the table directly below. 
		</p>

		<table border = "1">
  			<tr>
    			<th>Month</th>
   				<th>Savings</th>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
    			<td>January</td>
    			<td>$250</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
    			<td>February</td>
    			<td>$300</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
    			<td>March</td>
    			<td>$150</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
    			<td colspan="2">Sum: $700</td>
  			</tr>
		</table>

    The notes on HTML provided for us are accurate guides for someone trying to learn the basics of HTML except with some outdated information. Some examples of this are primarily recommending users to use internet explorer and Netscape to test their files. It's more likely that today's students would use Chrome or Firefox to test their files. Additionally, Netscape has been shut down since the time these notes were created. That is a specific example but there are other instances where some stuff is outdated but it may also be due to my own lack of experience. For instance, the notes tell us to always include '<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC “-//W3CD//DTD HTML 4.01//EN”>' whereas I have been taught that '<!DOCTYPE HTML>' is all that is necessary.
