				The Dark Knight is my favorite movie of all time. I love everything about it from it's amazing villain to ambiguous meaning for what a hero is. The movie is non-stop action and does a great job of giving the audience more questions wrapped up in answers for other questions. It is a movie that I have seen multiple times because I can relate to the feeling of being intimidated and frightened and fearful. All of these emotions are strong conflicts shown by Bruce Wayne throughout the movie that he must overcome. The cinematography is great and showed me that a superhero movie can be groundbreaking while having its main character wear a cape.
